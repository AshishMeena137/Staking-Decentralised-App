# Project Local Setup Guide
Welcome to the project! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the development environment locally.
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js.
Git: Download and install Git.
Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AshishMeena137/Staking-Decentralised-App.git
```
# install dependencies in main folder
```
npm install

cd FrontEnd

Install Dependencies
# Install dependencies inside frontend folder
npm install
```
### Ethereum Wallet Setup
Install MetaMask: Download and install MetaMask.
Create or Import an Ethereum Account: Follow the MetaMask setup process to create or import an Ethereum account.
Smart Contract Deployment
Before running the React app, deploy your Ethereum smart contracts.
```
# Assuming you have your smart contract code ready and configured in the project
# Deploy your contracts using your preferred Ethereum development environment (Ganache, Hardhat, etc.)
```
### Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following variables:
```
PROJECT_ID = API_KEY
MNEMONIC = WRITE_YOUR_METAMASK_MNEMONIC
```
Replace YOUR_STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS and YOUR_STAKE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the actual addresses of your deployed contracts.
Run the React App
# Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the app.
Interact with the App
Connect your MetaMask wallet to the app.
Follow the app's UI to stake tokens, withdraw, claim rewards, etc.
### Additional Notes
Make sure your local Ethereum development environment is running.
Smart contracts and wallet addresses are placeholders; replace them with your actual deployed contracts and addresses.
